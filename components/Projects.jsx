            My first encounter with web development was when I was 13 years old. I learned to build a website using Microsoft Frontpage &amp; Dreamweaver, building HTML layout using tables. I even won several web design competitions during my junior high school time. Since then, I loved web design and everything related to web development. Now that I think about it, itâ€™s amazing to see how web technology always evolving. From table layout now we can easily create layout with CSS grid.
