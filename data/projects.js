      'Droplet is the result of forming an IoT object through some critical design workshops involving plastic bottle. We have prototyped Droplet with a simple water filter using activated carbon as a filtering agent. This filter design can most definitely be improved upon, and also varied according to the particular needs of the user. The combination of water filter and water quality meter application enables Droplet as a supporting device for water quality data crowdsourcing. An assembly of sensors technology and mobile app, Droplet creates an opportunity for the community to engage in collecting water quality data at the same time get the benefit of accessing clean water through a portable and easy to use device. A future research about the use of Droplet as a crowdsourcing device should be conducted.',
