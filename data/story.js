      'My first encounter with web development was when I was 13 years old. I learned to build a website using Microsoft Frontpage &amp; Dreamweaver, building HTML layout using tables. I even won several web design competitions during my junior high school time. Since then, I loved web design and everything related to web development. Now that I think about it, it’s amazing to see how web technology always evolving. From table layout now we can easily create layout with CSS grid.',

      'Because of my passion of computer and engineering, I continued my study in Informatics Engineering at Duta Wacana Christian University. It’s a small private university in my hometown, a small city called Yogyakarta. Even though I didn’t went into any prestigious public university like my friends did, it didn’t stop me to dream big. I keep learning and keep dreaming that someday I can continue to study abroad or working abroad. During my bachelor’s degree, I am grateful to be granted as the awardee of Scranton’s Women Scholarship. This motivated me to pursue my dream. During this time also, I learned about Human-Computer Interaction, and how important user experience is when developing a user interface.',

One of my motivation was, Stockholm tech scene is considered one of the leading in the world, and it is growing. I want to get closer to the creative people behind big innovation such as Spotify, Mojang, King, etc. And all the preparation was paid of. ',

      'At KTH, I learned a lot about interaction design, UX research, UX design, and user behaviour. It completed my knowledge and sharpened my skill to deliver a great user experience in every user interface that I will build. In the summer I did an internship at Ericsson in Kista. I was tasked to do a user research around their testing system. The result of the internship was a report of problems found and the proposed solution to improve the user experience in the testing area. ',
